The pet is provided a RFID fob, which, in the vicinity of the the RFID reader, instructs the controller to dispense food with respect to an earlier programmed quantity. The water level and load are measured by sensors and provided to the Raspberry pi using SPI interface. The user is provided with a keypad and a LCD Panel to interact with the system.
